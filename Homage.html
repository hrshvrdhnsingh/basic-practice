        <strong>History::</strong> <br/>
        Litti, sometimes, along with chokha, is a complete meal that originated from the Bhojpuri region of the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
        Although very often confused with the closely related Rajasthani dish, baati, it is a completely different dish in terms of taste, texture and preparation.
        The litti are traditionally baked over a wood fire, but in the modern days, a new fried version has been developed.
        <br/>Litti Chokha holds a significant place in the culinary traditions and cultural heritage of Bihar, India. Its origin can be traced back to the historical
        roots of the state, where it emerged as a humble and nourishing meal for farmers and labourers.

        <strong id="cultural">Cultural Significance::</strong> <br/>
        Bihar, known for its agricultural landscape, required a hearty dish that could provide sustenance to those working long hours in the fields.
        Litti Chokha was developed as a practical and nutritious solution. The dish offered a perfect balance of flavours and ingredients that could 
        be easily prepared and consumed. Farmers and labourers would make Litti Chokha by using locally available ingredients, making it an affordable 
        and sustainable option for their everyday meals.The historical significance of Litti Chokha lies in its connection to the land and its people. 
        It showcases the resourcefulness and ingenuity of the Bihari community, who crafted a dish that encapsulated the essence of their agrarian 
        lifestyle and their love for flavorful, wholesome food.Today, Litti Chokha has transcended regional boundaries and gained recognition beyond Bihar.

        <strong>Taste Experience::</strong> <br/>
        The taste experience of Litti Chokha is a delightful journey for the palate. The outer shell of the Litti, which is made from a dough of wheat flour,
        becomes wonderfully crispy and golden when baked or roasted. As you take a bite, the crust breaks to reveal the flavorful and aromatic filling inside.
        The filling is a combination of mashed vegetables, including roasted eggplant, tomatoes, onions, and a medley of aromatic spices. The smoky flavours 
        from the roasted eggplant and the tanginess of the tomatoes create a harmonious blend of flavours that is both satisfying and tantalizing. The onions 
        and spices add a depth of taste, with hints of warmth and spiciness that elevate the dish.The contrasting textures further enhance the taste experience.

        To enhance the flavours even more, Litti Chokha is traditionally served with a side of Chokha. This side dish is a mashed mixture of roasted eggplant, 
        tomatoes, onions, and garlic, seasoned with spices and herbs. The Chokha adds an extra layer of smokiness and freshness to the overall dish, complementing 
        the flavours of the Litti perfectly.
        <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
        <strong>Preparation::</strong> <br/>
        <em>Dough Preparation:</em> The process begins by kneading wheat flour with water and a pinch of salt to create a smooth and pliable dough. The dough is then left 
        to rest for some time, allowing it to attain the desired consistency.
        <br/><em>Filling Preparation:</em> The spicy mashed vegetable filling is a crucial component of Litti Chokha. Traditionally, the vegetables used for the filling include 
        roasted eggplant, tomatoes, onions, and a blend of aromatic spices. The vegetables are roasted until they are tender and charred, which imparts a smoky flavour to the 
        dish. After roasting, the vegetables are mashed and mixed with spices, such as chilli powder, turmeric, cumin, and coriander, to create a flavorful filling.
        <br/><em>Stuffing the Littis:</em> Small portions of the dough are taken and shaped into balls. Each ball is then flattened into a disc shape using the palms of the hands. 
        The spicy mashed vegetable filling is placed in the centre of the disc, and the dough is carefully sealed around it, ensuring that the filling remains enclosed.
        <br/><em>Baking or Roasting:</em> Traditionally, Littis are baked in a wood-fired clay oven called a "chulha" or roasted on charcoal. The Littis are placed directly on the 
        heated surface and cooked until they develop a golden-brown crust. During the cooking process, the Littis absorb the smoky flavours from the fire, enhancing the overall 
        taste. Alternatively, Littis can also be baked in a preheated oven until they achieve a similar golden-brown colour and crispness.
        <br/><em>Serving:</em> Once the Littis are cooked to perfection, they are served hot with the generous help of Chokha. The Chokha, a mashed mixture of roasted eggplant, 
        tomatoes, onions, and garlic, adds a layer of flavour and freshness to the dish. To further enhance the taste and richness, a drizzle of ghee (clarified butter) is often added on top.
